Task 2: Automation of the Web Site
- I have used SmartBear TestComplete to automate the website
- C# scripting has been used
- No native features of TestComplete have been used.
- Only descriptive programming has been used to locate web objects.
- The scripts folder includes three five scripts. (1) Login (2) CreateTest (3) Verify (4) TestLog_Function (5) DDT_ExcelDriver
- No hardcoding has been done. Excel file has been used to insert data.
